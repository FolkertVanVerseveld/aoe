## Building the game

This project does not provide binary builds at the moment, which means you have
to build the project in order to play the game.

Instructions are provided in [INSTALL](../INSTALL).

## Running the game

All game data required to run the game is located on the CD-ROM. The CD-ROM
should be auto-detected if you start the game after inserting the CD-ROM.

If the CD-ROM is not recognized, make sure you have inserted the Age of Empires
CD-ROM correctly and that the CD-ROM is mounted properly.

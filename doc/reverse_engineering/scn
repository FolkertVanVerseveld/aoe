The scenario file format has a flat header followed by deflated data. See this
thread for details:

astr16 is pascal string where first two bytes is u16 specifying its length
dword is u32

scn header
  range type   name    description
  00-03        version 1.10 or 1.11 in all scenarios we have tested so far
  04-07        length  length of file excluding header?
  08-0B        dword8  reserved (==2)
  0C-0F        modtime modification timestamp
  10-13 astr16 inst_sz instructions length
  14-XX        inst    instructions
  XX-XX
  14-17        dword14 padding?
  18-1B        players player count
  1C-XX        data    compressed scenario data

compressed scenario data (scn header 3)
  00-03 dword0 unknown metadata size? no idea

  04-07 u32 magic header 33 33 93 3f

  player nicknames at 0x008, 0x108, 0x208, ..., 0xff8 ??

  sections are separated using 9d ff ff ff
  first section always starts at 0x1000

  1000 some dword numbers (hex) in this pattern:
  0 0 1 1
  1 4 1 0
  2 4 0 0
  3 4 0 0
  4 4 0 0
  5 4 0 0
  6 4 0 0
  7 4 0 0
  8 4 0 0
  9 4 0 0
  a 4 0 0
  b 4 0 0
  c 4 0 0
  d 4 0 0
  e 4 0 0
  f 4 0 0
  10 4 1 80000000

  first number is player index, 10 is gaia
  second number unknown
  third number can be claimed? (except 10 for gaia i assume)
  fourth number must be claimed

  third and fourth number seem inconsistent though

  for loading i assume we can ignore these numbers

  then the byte 0xbf (or bytes 0x80 0xbf, not sure)

  astr16 filename
  astr16 instructions

  then lots of astr16 follow, keep going till we find section separator 9d ff ff ff
  not sure what these are used for. doesn't look like individual victory, more like AI strategy?

    some astr16's found in here are:
    "NONE"
    " <none> "
    "Random"
    "Default"

  list of dwords, either 00, 0xc8 or 0x96, ended by 9d ff ff ff

  byte 01, some zeros, then dword 0x0384 and 0x2328??

Color palettes

In the ol' days, when 256 colors was pretty common, color palettes were
used to represent which rgb values represent a indexed color in the
palette.

Age of Empires uses JASC palette that were probably made using something
like Paintshop Pro. You can find the format description here:

Basically, it is something like this (assuming CRLF line endings):
text-only format starting with header: "JASC-PAL\r\n0100\r\n"
followed by the number of entries (usually 256)
and the rgb pairs separated by whitespace.

The header looks like this:
0000 4A 41 53 43 2D 50 41 4C 0D 0A 30 31 30 30 0D 0A JASC-PAL..0100..

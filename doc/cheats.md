# Cheat codes

The original Age of Empires and the Rise of Rome expansion shipped multiple
cheats codes that could be entered to 'enhance' the gameplay. Also, the cheat
codes also ease the process for developers to quickly test the game engine or
something else.

There are two different kind of cheats codes:

1. Relaxed cheat codes
2. Strict cheat codes

The strict cheat codes must be typed as they are shown without any text
preceeding or following the text. The relaxed cheat codes also work if some text
preceeds or follows the cheat code. Example: "i am king arthur" is interpreted
as the "king arthur" cheat code while "wolololo this is hoyohoyo" is not
interpreted as "hoyohoyo".

*All cheat codes are case insensitive*

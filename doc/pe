Gathered stuff that we know about Portable Executable's

Portable Executables are ancient executable files designed when windows
NT 3.1 was being developed. Due to the nature of Microsof, it has been
inherited all up to OS'es like Windows 10. It is a real pain to parse it
easily and efficiently.
An in-depth article about the format from Redmond itself:

I recommend viewing the archived article since the current one has
multiple formatting issues:

-- pcrio --

Mikko P (a.k.a. Tapsa) has been maintaining pcrio which is a very simple
resource viewer/editor for pe/coff files. Unfortunately, it suffers a
lot from fragmentation due to allocating each node in the resource
section one at a time.
His repository is here:

-- tools/xmap --

We have written an alternative to Tapsa's pcrio that takes fully
advantage of posix functionality like mmap in order to dramatically
reduce the amount of malloc's.
All PE related structures have more unix like names (i.e. short and
cryptic) to make it short, simple and easier to use.

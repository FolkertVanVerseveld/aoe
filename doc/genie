Genie game engine

The Genie game engine has been in development since at least 1997 while
the original Age of Empires was being developed. The engine has
undergone multiple revisions in Rise of Rome and the sequels.

All data files are custom formatted archives which mostly contain linked
lists to data blocks which contain the raw resource data. These files
are suffixes `drs'. In the file tree. We will can them Data Resource Set
or just drs file when we refer to a drs archive.

For a simple freestanding implementation that can extract wave files
while traversing drs files, see tools/drs.c

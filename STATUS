The current state of the project is documented here. At the moment, it
cannot do anything meaningful yet. It can load and parse game assets,
parse command line options provided by the original game and some
additional ones, and it loads and parses string tables located in the
language .dll files from the original game.

Working:
* CD-ROM reading and music playback
* Read and locate game assets in data resource sets (drs).
* Inspecting and (un)packing drs files.
* MIDI playback

In progress (in random order):
* User interface
* Menu navigation
* Background file parsing
* Main menu
* Console integration
* True Type Fonts
* Crash handling

The current state of the project is documented here. At the moment, it
cannot do anything meaningful yet. It can load and parse game assets,
parse command line options provided by the original game and some
additional ones, and it loads and parses string tables located in the
language .dll files from the original game.

Working:
* read and locate game assets in data resource sets (drs).
* fetch utf7 strings from original language files (utf8 is planned).
* load and save default game configuration settings.
* inspecting and (un)packing drs files.
* MIDI playback

In progress:
* menu navigation
* background file parsing
* main menu
* audio subsystem

TROUBLESHOOTING
In general, if you experience odd or erroneous behavior, you should try building
from source with debug options enabled. This can be achieved by navigating to
the root directory and issuing these commands:
$ cd src && make clean
$ ./configure -g -DDEBUG && make

REPORTING BUGS
Remember that at the moment this project is very unstable and lacks lots of
functionality compared to the original game. Before reporting bugs make sure the
following conditions are satisfied:

Clean build
Always build from scratch (i.e. run `make clean && make') and make sure your
problem is reproducable.

Bug description
Provide a description of the bug and how it is triggered. If it is not
reproducable on your site, it probably is not on our side either. You have to
provide all output that is printed when running `./empx -v'

Unique bug
Duplicates or similar bugs that are already reported are ignored. If you are
sure it is not a duplicate you have to tell why you think it is unique.

Example
This is an example of a good bug report:

  Subject: aoe crash on missing language files
  aoe crashes when the specified root path does not contain language files. One
  can reproduce this by moving the language files language.dll and languagex.dll
  to another directory and running the game using `./empx -r/root/path'. See
  attachment for `./empx -v' output.

Use your common sense when filing a bug report. This will save time for both
parties. If you are really willing to help improve development you can fix the
bugs yourself and submit a pull request or patch so we can apply the changes. It
goes without saying that you provide a good description *why* we should merge a
particular contribution.

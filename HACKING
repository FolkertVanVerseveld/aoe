Interesting and useful information for modifying the source code is
located here.

Memory allocation
Since there is a lot of c++ boilerplate code, we have replaced some
allocations with fixed arrays. Most of them are marked with noptr.

Markers
Several markers are placed in code to make it easier to search for
modifications in the codebase. Some of them include:

todo  need to complete this task at some point in time
xxx   not sure whether this is correct (may be a question)
remap type of variable in original code is different in our port
noptr converted dynamic memory to fixed array
fixme bug/glitch that needs to be fixed

Modified blocks of code are marked with `<' and `>'. The first is our
own code and the latter indicates that the dissassembled code follows.

TOOLS

In tools/ we have provided multiple freestanding programs that inspect
the original data files and make porting the game a lot easier.

These tools include:
convert: dump binary compatible source file
pestat: dump standard portable executable members and parameters
drs: dump assets while traversing a data resource set(=drs)
str: extract strings as utf7 data ignoring file format or empty strings
rsrc: fetches string data from portable executables

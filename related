OpenAge https://github.com/SFTtech/openage

OpenAOE replicates the original Age of Empires and borrows some features from
Rise of Rome like build queuing. It also uses SDL2 for event handling and
rendering.

OpenAge has been in development since August 18th 2013 and is still under active
development. It also replicates the genie game engine with its own flavor on top
of it.

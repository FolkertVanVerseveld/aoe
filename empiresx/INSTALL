Ubuntu setup (18.04 LTS):

        sudo apt install libsdl2{,-image,-mixer,-ttf}-dev
        cmake .
        make

VStudio setup (Community Edition 2019):

setup dev libs:
* download development libs:
  https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.10-VC.zip
  https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL2_image-devel-2.0.5-VC.zip
  https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.4-VC.zip
  https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL2_ttf-devel-2.0.15-VC.zip

* unpack in e.g.: ~/cmake/libs
* copy both .cmake files from this project cmake/ to ~/cmake/libs

then, add environment variables to windows:
* META+E, right-click "This PC"->Properties->Change Settings->Advanced->Environment variables
* Add vars: SDL2_DIR, SDL2_IMAGE_DIR, SDL2_MIXER_DIR, SDL2_TTF_DIR

if setup correctly, the project should compile now, but you can't run it yet
finally, copy all dll files from ~/cmake/libs/*.dll to out/Debug/whatever/huge/ass/path/VStudio/creates/to/the/exe
if your libs folder has 32 and 64 bit dlls, make sure to copy the correct ones (i.e. 32 bit if your target is 32 bit, 64 bit idem)

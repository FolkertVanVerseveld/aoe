## Overview

Cross-platform free software game port of Microsoft's original Age of Empires
and the Rise of Rome expansion.

It tries to take fully advantage of modern technology and APIs while mimicking
the windows API and the genie game engine for compatibility reasons. In order to
achieve this, some code is reconstructed from the dissassembly. We have provided
a couple of tools that verify, test, and inspect the original data files.

You still need to own an original legitimate copy of Age of Empires in order to
run this program, since you need the original game data to run the game.

Community free assets are not supported at the moment, but there are tools
included if you want to make your own. It is not recommended to create your own
at the moment because we haven't figured out what all resources are needed for
and what dimensions, colors etc. the game expects.

## User Guide

A simple, incomplete user guide is available [here](doc/user_guide.md).

## Status

At the moment, there's only very basic gameplay. Some villager tasks are
implemented as well as a very dumb CPU player. See the github project for most
up-to-date info: [AoE](https://github.com/FolkertVanVerseveld/aoe).

## Support

Windows has first class support, while an Ubuntu based Linux should compile the
project just fine.

For more information how to install and run AoE, see [INSTALL](INSTALL).

## Troubleshooting

Make sure you own a legitimate copy of the original Age of Empires or Rise of
Rome expansion and you have specified the root directory to AoE (RoR) correctly.
See [known issues and bugs](BUGS.md) for more details.

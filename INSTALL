BUILDING THE GAME

All code is spread across multiple directories. The game engine itself is
located in genie/, the game in game/ and tools in tools/ (as you can see, it is
pretty self-explanatory).

You can build the game and the tools using:

  ./configure && make

Or if you prefer running it in parallel:

  ./configure && make -j8

Where `-j8' means `use 8 cores'.

INSTALLING THE GAME

Before you can run the executable, you have to copy the file to your AoE
directory so it can find and load the data files. You can run it by double
clicking it or starting it from a shell/terminal/whatever you prefer.

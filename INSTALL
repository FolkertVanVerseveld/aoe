BUILDING THE GAME

All code is spread across multiple directories. The game engine itself is
located in genie/, the game in game/ and tools in tools/ (as you can see, it is
pretty self-explanatory).

You can build the game and the tools using:

  ./configure && make

Or if you prefer running it in parallel:

  ./configure && ./make_parallel

If your genie/ build is up to date, you can also make it in parallel using:

  ./configure && make -j8

Where `-j8' means `use 8 cores'. Normally, we should not have to provide a make
parallel script, but at the moment we are not sure how to fix this properly.
This workaround should be sufficient for now, albeit a bit clumsy.

INSTALLING THE GAME

Before you can run the executable, you have to copy the file to your AoE
directory so it can find and load the data files. You can run it by double
clicking it or starting it from a shell/terminal/whatever you prefer.

BUILDING THE GAME

All code is spread across multiple directories. The game setup installer is
located in setup/, the original game in empires/. The game engine itself is
located in genie/ and tools in tools/ (as you can see, it is pretty
self-explanatory).

Note that setup/ and reverse_engineering/ are pretty outdated. genie/ and
empires/ are actively maintained.

The genie engine requires XenoTech's cross platform common library v1.0.1 or
better, which you can find at: https://github.com/XenoTech-Inc/libxtcommon

You can build the game using:

  make

Or if you prefer running it in parallel:

  make -j8

Where `-j8' means `use 8 cores'.

INSTALLING THE GAME

After inserting an original AoE CD-ROM, the game should automatically find all
the necessary files. You can also build an ISO image from the original CD-ROM.
The provided setup program is not necessary to run in order to play the game.

INSTALLATION RECIPIES

Xubuntu 18 and 16:

This project has been built primarly on Xubuntu 16. The following packages are
needed:

  gcc make libssl-dev pkg-config libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libopenal-dev

For empires/ you need libpe and openssl which you can install on Xubuntu 16
using:

sudo apt-get install pev libssl-dev

Note that the linking order on Xubuntu 14 for openssl and pev is broken! You
have to swap the crypto and ssl libs during linking. Also, you will need to use
a more recent version of GCC (probably version 5 or better).

Windows:

Currently, empires.exe and some tools are known to compile and run successfully.
Both can be compiled either with a native MinGW toolchain or within cygwin with
its MinGW cross-compiler.

All dependencies can be downloaded from libsdl.org. You don't have to compile
these as long as you are using MinGW or Microsoft's Visual C++ Compiler

When running make with a cross compiler or MinGW, you also have to specify
CROSS_COMPILE=1 or CROSS_COMPILE=32 if you want to build a 32-bit executable.

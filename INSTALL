BUILDING THE GAME

All code is spread across multiple directories. The game setup installer is
located in setup/, the original game in empires/. The game engine itself is
located in genie/, the game in game/ and tools in tools/ (as you can see, it is
pretty self-explanatory).

Note that game/, genie/ and tools/ are pretty outdated. setup/ and empires/ are
actively maintained.

You can build the game using:

  make

Or if you prefer running it in parallel:

  make -j8

Where `-j8' means `use 8 cores'.

INSTALLING THE GAME

Before you can run the executable, you have to copy the file to your AoE
directory so it can find and load the data files. You can run it by double
clicking it or starting it from a shell/terminal/whatever you prefer.

INSTALLATION RECIPIES

Xubuntu 18 and 16:

This project has been built primarly on Xubuntu 16. The following packages are
needed:

  gcc make libssl-dev pkg-config libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libopenal-dev

For empires/ you need libpe and openssl which you can install on Xubuntu 16
using:

sudo apt-get install pev libssl-dev

Note that the linking order on Xubuntu 14 for openssl and pev is broken! You
have to swap the crypto and ssl libs during linking.

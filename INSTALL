BUILDING THE GAME

All code that actually mimicks Age of Empires Rise of Rome (AoE RoR) is
located in src/. You can build this using:

./configure && make

Then you can run the game by specifying the directory where your AoE RoR
installation is located using:

./empx -r/usr/local/games/aoe1

Assuming the game is located at /usr/local/games/aoe1. The specified
path may be relative.

INSTALLING THE GAME

You should not install the game in /usr/local/ or something similar yet,
since this project is not stable at all.

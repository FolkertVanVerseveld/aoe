### Chariot

Chariot is the successor to OpenAOE as of 2017-05-09. It can read and show
multiple game resources, but there is no game to be played.

### OpenAge

OpenAge has been in development since August 18th 2013 and is still under active
development. It also replicates the genie game engine with its own flavor on top
of it.

### OpenAOE

*This project is succeeded by Chariot*

OpenAOE replicates the original Age of Empires game and borrows some features
from Rise of Rome like build queuing. It also uses SDL2 for event handling and
rendering.

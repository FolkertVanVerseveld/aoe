Linux native game port of windows game Age of Empires Rise of Rome

All copyrighted material and trademarks belong to their respective owners. This
is an educational non-profit project we are writing in our free time.

It tries to take fully advantage of POSIX while mimicking the windows API and
the genie game engine for compatibility reasons. In order to achieve this, some
code is reconstructed from the dissassembly. We have provided a couple of tools
that verify, test, and inspect the original data files.

You still need to have an original installed version of Age of Empires in order
to run this program, since you need to specify the location of the original
data directory.

BUILDING THE GAME

In order to build the project you will need:
* gcc
* bash
* pkg-config
* SDL2
* SDL2_image
* OpenGL support

This project has been built primarly for Xubuntu 14, but it should build
on any POSIX-compatible machine that provides the packages listed above.

For more information, see INSTALL.

RUNNING THE GAME

If your original installed version of Age of Empires is located at e.g.
/usr/local/games/aoe1 you can run it like this:

./empx -r/usr/local/games/aoe1

For more information about the commandline options, use ./empx -h
See also INSTALL for more details.

TROUBLESHOOTING
Make sure you own a legal version of Age of Empires Rise of Rome and you have
specified the root directory to AoE RoR correctly. See BUGS for more details.

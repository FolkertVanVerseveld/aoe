Most code is reconstructed from the dissassembly and we have written a
couple of tools to inspect the original data files.

You still need to have an original installed version of Age of Empires
in order to run this program, since you need to specify the location of
the original data directory.

RUNNING THE GAME

If your original installed version of Age of Empires is located at e.g.
/usr/local/games/aoe1 you can run it like this:

./empx -r/usr/local/games/aoe1

For more information about the commandline options, use ./empx -h
